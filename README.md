# My Capstone Project
This github.io website contains the capstone project for my CS-499 class at Southern New Hampshire University. The assignment was to take a final project from a previous class and enhance it in three areas: software design, data structures and algorithms, and databases.

# About me 
In the Fall of 2021, I started my journey in the Computer Science program while pursuing my biology degree. In the spring of 2021, despite graduating holding an associate degree in biology, I made the bold decision to switch majors and schools, I switched my major to Computer science with a minor in Software Engineering. I was driven by the belief in the importance of technology and programming. Despite being relatively new to the program, my enthusiasm and dedication have propelled me forward, eagerly embracing every opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills in this dynamic field. I’ve always aspired to make a positive impact in the world, and with technology playing an increasingly vital role in our daily lives, I’m determined to be a part of that transformative change.

#	What have you learned while in the program? List three of the most important concepts or skills you have learned.
Throughout my academic journey in the program, I have gained valuable knowledge and skills in various aspects of computer science and software engineering. Three of the most important concepts or skills I have learned include:
- Mobile Application Development: I have learned how to design, develop, and deploy mobile applications using languages such as Java and tools like the Android SDK. This includes understanding mobile-specific design patterns, user interface development, and integration of features such as location services and sensors.
-  Algorithm Design and Analysis: I have acquired a solid understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures, as well as techniques for designing efficient algorithms to solve complex problems. This includes topics such as sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and algorithmic complexity analysis.
-  Database Management: I have learned about relational database management systems (RDBMS) and SQL, including database design, normalization, querying, and optimization. Additionally, I have gained experience in integrating databases into software applications to persistently store and manage data.

# Discuss the specific skills you aim to demonstrate through your enhancements to reach each of the course outcomes.
For each of the course outcomes, I aim to demonstrate the following specific skills through my enhancements:
-	Employ strategies for building collaborative environments: I will demonstrate collaboration skills by effectively communicating with team members, incorporating feedback, and coordinating tasks to achieve project goals. This will be evident in how I engage with stakeholders and solicit input during the enhancement process.
-	Design and evaluate computing solutions: Through enhancements such as integrating barcode scanning and implementing advanced database functionality, I will showcase skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and evaluating alternative solutions. I will also manage trade-offs in design choices, considering factors such as performance, usability, and scalability.
-	Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques: I will showcase proficiency in utilizing well-founded techniques such as algorithm design principles and software engineering best practices. Additionally, I will demonstrate innovation by incorporating advanced features and exploring cutting-edge technologies to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the Inventory App.


# How do the specific skills you will demonstrate align with your career plans related to your degree?
The specific skills I aim to demonstrate align closely with my career plans in software development and engineering. By showcasing proficiency in mobile application development, algorithm design, database management, and software engineering principles, I am positioning myself for roles that involve designing, developing, and maintaining software solutions for mobile platforms or enterprise applications.

# How does this contribute to the specialization you are targeting for your career?
The skills I will demonstrate contribute directly to the specialization I am targeting in software development, particularly in the mobile and database domains. By enhancing the Inventory App with advanced features such as barcode scanning and data mining, I am not only broadening my skill set but also deepening my expertise in areas that are highly relevant to my career specialization. This will make me a competitive candidate for roles that require expertise in mobile app development, algorithm design, and database management.
