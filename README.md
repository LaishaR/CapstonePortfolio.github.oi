# My Capstone Project
This github.io website contains the capstone project for my CS-499 class at Southern New Hampshire University. The assignment was to take a final project from a previous class and enhance it in three areas: software design, data structures and algorithms, and databases.

# About me 
In the Fall of 2021, I started my journey in the Computer Science program while pursuing my biology degree. In the spring of 2021, despite graduating holding an associate degree in biology, I made the bold decision to switch majors and schools, I switched my major to Computer science with a minor in Software Engineering. I was driven by the belief in the importance of technology and programming. Despite being relatively new to the program, my enthusiasm and dedication have propelled me forward, eagerly embracing every opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills in this dynamic field. I’ve always aspired to make a positive impact in the world, and with technology playing an increasingly vital role in our daily lives, I’m determined to be a part of that transformative change.

#	What have you learned while in the program? List three of the most important concepts or skills you have learned.
Throughout my academic journey in the program, I have gained valuable knowledge and skills in various aspects of computer science and software engineering. Three of the most important concepts or skills I have learned include:
- Mobile Application Development: I have learned how to design, develop, and deploy mobile applications using languages such as Java and tools like the Android SDK. This includes understanding mobile-specific design patterns, user interface development, and integration of features such as location services and sensors.
-  Algorithm Design and Analysis: I have acquired a solid understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures, as well as techniques for designing efficient algorithms to solve complex problems. This includes topics such as sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and algorithmic complexity analysis.
-  Database Management: I have learned about relational database management systems (RDBMS) and SQL, including database design, normalization, querying, and optimization. Additionally, I have gained experience in integrating databases into software applications to persistently store and manage data.
